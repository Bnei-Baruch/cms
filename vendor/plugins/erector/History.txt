=== 0.2.83 / 2008-04-23

* "erect" supports command-line options
* "erect" now works backwards -- you can output static html from a widget.rb file
* The web site is generated from erector classes (still pretty minimal though)

=== 0.2.61 / 2008-04-18

* Improvements to "erect"
  * works on HTML attributes (including namespaced attributes and hyphenated attributes)
  * works on directories (recursively looking for .html and .html.erb and .rhtml files)
  * converts DOCTYPE nodes
  * deals with HTML entities inside text and attributes

=== 0.2.54 / 2008-04-15

* New script "erect" to convert (some) .html.erb files into erector classes.

=== 0.2.42 / 2008-04-11

* Rails Controller now can render Erector widgets using #render
* Erector views can live inside Rails "app/views" directory, just like other views

=== 0.1.25 / 2008-02-26

* nbsp method
* :class => ['one', 'two']  (that is, passing an array rather than a string)
... perhaps one or two I forgot.
* rename tag to element
* add empty_element feature
* for the built-in HTML tags, knows which ones should be empty and which shouldn't be.
  For example, generates `<input />` rather than `<input></input>`
* text and attributes are quoted by default; call raw to avoid this
* h is rarely necessary now, but it returns a string rather than appending to the buffer
* nbsp method turns spaces into non-breaking spaces
* sending in an array for attribute values (typically CSS classes) concatenates them separated by spaces
* The column definition name can be a Proc that gets executed.
* Renamed instruct! to instruct (old one remains as a deprecated method for now), as it is no more side-effecting (or dangerous or whatever) than any other method in Widget.

=== 0.1.0 / 2008-02-13

* First public release

=== 0.0.1

* Was on pivotalrb.rubyforge.org
